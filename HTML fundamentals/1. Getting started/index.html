    <p>
        There're a lot of youtube tutorials and udemy classes but did you know that 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" title="MDN home page" target="_blank">
            <strong>
                MDN
            </strong>
        </a>
        - the official coding documentation website - has a well 
        <strong>
            thought through
        </strong> 
        and clearly 
        <strong>
            structured
        </strong> 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML" title="html tutorial for beginners" target="_blank">

         of their own? And it's completely

        My first class in 
        <a href="https://www.codesmith.io/" title="Codesmith home page">
            Codesmith
        </a> 
        immersive was not very informative. I was stuck trying to make Live Share work in 
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="Visual Studio Code home page">
            VS Code
        </a> 
        and lost a lot of coding time because of that.
